"Who's a Good Boy?!" - Final Project - UCB Bootcamp
Project Group: Sean Lane, Grace Hsu, Casey Hill

Problem Statement: Determine the breed of dog in a photo.

Congratulations! You are now a proud parent of your newly adopted dog. However, you don’t know what type of breed your dog is. Although you could find out using an expensive DNA test, there’s a more cost effective method to do so. Simply, upload a photo and find out for free!

We intend to deploy a model that will be able to determine the breed of your dog with an efficacy rate above 80%. This model will use over 10,000 training images as well as 10,000 test images. After our training and testing we will use Nanonets to strengthen our model with a deeper learning library for increased accuracy.

Early discovery and cleaning provided us a clean and easy to assemble dataset. since it has been used in professional competition. We found 10,222 images for test and 10,357 for training. These images came with list identification to help us connect our images with their identifiers.

Our plan will be to use our fully trained model to then determine the breed of Grace's Dog either in class or before our presentation. Our goal will be to demonstrate our model in class, to both show the models accuracy and for visual appeal of our presentation.

Machine Learning: Learning dog image features using Deep Learning. Data Cleansing: Pandas and Numpy Libraries to clean and arrange our data for Machine Learning Languages: Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Sci-Kit Learn, NanoNet

Other Programming Languages/Libraries: TABLEAU MATPLOTLIB HTML/CSS/BOOTSTRAP PYTHON FLASK APP

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data? Over 20,000 images of dog breeds and identifiers to split between test and training data.
