    "Congratulations! You are now a proud parent of your newly adopted dog. However, you don’t know what type of breed your dog is. Although you could find out using an expensive DNA test, there’s a more cost effective method to do so. Simply, upload a photo and find out for free!\n",

    "We intend to deploy a model that will be able to determine the breed of your dog with an efficacy rate above 80%. This model will use over 10,000 training images as well as 10,000 test images. After our training and testing we will use Nanonets to strengthen our model with a deeper learning library for increased accuracy.\n",
